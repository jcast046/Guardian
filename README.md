# Guardian
Guardian is a lightweight, AI-driven OSINT system focused on consolidating and analyzing reports of missing women and children.  The purpose of this project is to build a proof-of-concept tool that demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP), unsupervised machine learning, and geospatial visualization can be applied to identify trends, patterns, and hotspots to more directly assist in locating victims in missing person cases.
