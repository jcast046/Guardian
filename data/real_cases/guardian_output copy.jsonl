Brown hair, blue eyes. Angela's left eye protrudes.\n\nDetails of Disappearance\n\nAngela and her friend, Tammy Akers, were dropped off at William Ruffner Junior High School by one of the girls' relatives on\nFebruary 7, 1977 in Roanoke, Virginia. The girls did not attend classes that day and were last seen hitchhiking in the city. Neither\ngirl has been heard from again.\n\nAngela and Tammy had run away together several times before their disappearances in 1977. The police originally did not take\ntheir disappearances seriously as a result.\n\nSeveral months after their disappearances, one of the girls' mothers got a phone call from someone saying she was her daughter\nand was all right. Tammy and Angela were also allegedly seen in a grocery store in the months after they vanished but that\nsighting was never confirmed.\n\nThe girls' mothers told authorities that Tammy and Angela worked for a friend of their families, Earl Conrad Bramblett, in 1977. A\nphoto of Bramblett is posted with this case summary. Tammy's mother stated that her daughter was friends with Bramblett and\nhis wife at the time, frequently spending time at their home. He did not seem to have any adult friends, just children. Investigators\nbelieve that Bramblett may have been involved in Tammy and Angela's disappearances. He reportedly told friends at a party in\n1980 that he wished he did not \"hurt Tammy\" back in 1977.\n\nBramblett was charged with molesting a ten-year-old girl in 1984 but acquitted. Tammy's older sister says he molested her when\nshe was twelve years old and she believes he molested Tammy as well. Bramblett convicted of murdering a Virginia family of four,\nBlaine and Teresa Hodges and their two children, in 1994 and sentenced to death. He was living with the Hodges family at the\ntime of their homicides.\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/angela-mae-rader\n\n3/6\n\n\f9/9/25, 8:51 PM\n\nAngela Mae Rader - The Charley Project\n\nA jailhouse informant told police that Bramblett had told him that he killed the Hodges family after being caught molesting one of\nthe children. The informant later recanted his statements, but Bramblett was executed in April 2003, still maintaining his\ninnocence. It's worth noting that Bramblett has many supporters (particularly online) who believe he was wrongly accused. The\nsame people maintain that both Tammy and Angela ran away from Roanoke voluntarily in 1977.\n\nEight months after Bramblett was sent to death row, authorities dug up the yard of the house he had been living in when Tammy\nand Angela disappeared. They found nothing and the residence's current owners did not give them permission to search inside the\nhouse, so they never had the opportunity to look in the basement where they believe Tammy and Angela may be buried.\n\nBramblett always maintained his innocence in the missing girls' cases. He said he was drunk when he made the statement about\n\"hurting Tammy\" in 1980 and his comment was misinterpreted. He said he believed Tammy died in a bonfire in central Florida in\n1980 and the police know about it and have tried to cover it up. There is no evidence to support Bramblett's theory, however.\n\nAuthorities never charged Bramblett in connection with the girls' disappearances. Angela's mother has since died; she believed her\ndaughter was still alive. Tammy's family believes she is deceased and Bramblett was connected to her disappearance.\n\nTammy's and Angela's cases remain open and unsolved.\n\nInvestigating Agency\n\nRoanoke City Police Department 540-853-5305\n\nSource Information\n\nChild Protection Education of America\n\nThe Roanoke Times\n\nWDBJ-7\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n\nOffice of the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney\n\nThe Doe Network\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/angela-mae-rader\n\n4/6\n\n\f9/9/25, 8:51 PM\n\nNamUs\n\nAngela Mae Rader - The Charley Project\n\nUpdated 5 times since October 12, 2004.

Brown hair, brown/green eyes.\n\nDetails of Disappearance\n\nBrenda was last seen in Woodbridge, Virginia on March 4, 1974. She lived in the Gleaton Trailer Park in the 13900 block of Gordon\nBoulevard with her parents and four younger siblings. According to her mother, she stole $100 from her father's wallet before she\nwent to classes at Fred Lynn Middle School. She didn't return home from school that day and has never been heard from again.\n\nAn employee at the local Greyhound bus station reported a young girl bought a bus ticket on the afternoon Brenda disappeared,\nbut the witness couldn't remember whether the girl was Brenda, whether she actually boarded the bus, and where that bus was\nheaded to. Brenda had reportedly spoken about wanting to run away to Florida. Two girls in her class at school did run away, but\nwhen they were found and brought home, Brenda wasn't with them.\n\nBrenda's younger sister Lisa, who was seven years old in 1974, describes their father as an alcoholic who physically abused his\nchildren and may have sexually abused Brenda. She said their mother told contradictory stories about the circumstances of\nBrenda's disappearance, and she thinks it's possible Brenda did not run away and that her parents knew more about her case than\nthey said.\n\nLisa's two older sisters, who were close to Brenda's age, recall little about the time Brenda disappeared. Lisa stated that after she\nwent missing, the family never spoke of her again, and their parents didn't keep any of her belongings.

Because of this, she is extremely susceptible to illness. She is great\nneed of medical attention.\n\nDistinguishing Characteristics\nBiracial (African-American/Caucasian) female. Black hair, brown eyes. Brittany has a light complexion and chicken pox scars on\nher face. She has a port-a-cath tube inserted into the upper left side of her chest, with resulting scarring. At the time of her\ndisappearance, her hair was cut very short due to a recent head lice infestation.\n\nDetails of Disappearance\n\nBrittany's mother, Rose Marie Thompson, was diagnosed with AIDS three months before Brittany's birth. During the first few years\nof the child's life, she was often in foster care due to Thompson's chaotic lifestyle.\n\nThompson gave Brittany to a guardian, Kim E. Parker, shortly before her death in 1996. A photograph of Parker is posted below\nthis case summary. The two women had met through Rainbow Kids Inc., a now-defunct charity which provided long-term care for\nchildren with AIDS and other serious medical problems. Parker founded the charity and also cared for other children with special\nneeds.\n\nParker lived off the Rainbow Kids donations, and the Social Security and Medicaid benefits for the children she cared for. Visitors\nto the house noted it was filthy, and multiple people who knew Parker reported her for child abuse and neglect.\n\nThe last person besides Parker to see Brittany was a doctor whom Brittany visited in August 2000. Around that same time, Parker\nasked Brittany's adult half-sister to take the child, saying she was troublesome and she couldn't handle her anymore. Brittany's\nhalf-sister declined, saying she couldn't handle the girl's medical needs.\n\nParker then said she would give Brittany to two friends, Linda Hodges or Jones and Kathie Evans. Parker later said she gave\nBrittany to Hodges and Evans in August 2000. The child's half-sister wanted to keep in touch with her, but Parker refused to\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/brittany-renee-williams\n\n5/9\n\n\f9/9/25, 8:45 PM\n\nBrittany Renee Williams - The Charley Project\n\nprovide contact information for the women.\n\nIn November 2000, Parker was arrested for truancy because Brittany had not returned to school for the 2000-2001 year. She told\nthe judge that Brittany was no longer in her custody, and the charges were dismissed. Hodges supposedly returned for Christmas\nthat year with Brittany, then left again with the child. Parker says she paid Jones $3,000 cash to take Brittany and later mailed her\nanother $5,000, but she had not heard from either Jones or Brittany since December 2000.\n\nIn 2001, Parker had to appear in court to explain why she hadn't taken Brittany to a paternity test. She told the same judge that\nBrittany was living with relatives, and there was no follow-up from the court. Parker continued to collect the child's $500 monthly\nbenefit check from the Virginia Department of Children and Families until the summer of 2002, using the money to renovate her\nhome. She stated that she expected Brittany to return to her care eventually.\n\nIn 2003, a newspaper who had run a story about Brittany tried to do a follow-up story, but Parker told the reporter Brittany no\nlonger lived with her. She said she did not know the addresses of the women allegedly caring for the child; she only said that she\nthought they were in California.\n\nIn January 2003, custody of Brittany was given to the local Social Services Department and they were ordered to find her. The\npolice opened up a missing child investigation. In February, Parker was ordered to serve 20 days in jail for contempt of court in\nconnection with her failure to tell police where Brittany was. Parker protested that she could not tell what she did not know.\n\nIn late March 2003, investigators located the two women Parker said she gave Brittany to. They were both volunteers with\nRainbow Kids Inc. and had been planning to have Brittany visit them in California, but the plans had not been finalized by the time\nshe disappeared and she never came to see them. Neither of them had ever had custody of Brittany or knew where she was. They\nhave joined in the search for her.\n\nIn April 2003, Parker was indicted on 73 felony charges, mostly fraud and money laundering, relating to Brittany's case. Authorities\nalleged she accepted over $16,000 from private individuals and the government for the care of Brittany when the girl was not\nliving in her home, and that she illegally attempted to conceal the sources of the money.\n\nParker pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud in July 2003. She was then charged with three counts\nof medical-assistance payment fraud, for allowing Brittany's Medicaid payments to continue needlessly. Medicaid paid about\n$8,000 in insurance premiums for Brittany after she left Parker's care.\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/brittany-renee-williams\n\n6/9\n\n\f9/9/25, 8:45 PM\n\nBrittany Renee Williams - The Charley Project\n\nIn May 2003, authorities thoroughly searched Parker's home and drained her septic system, looking for Brittany's remains or any\nsign that she had died there. A neighbor claimed she reported Parker twice for abusing and/or neglecting Brittany, and Hodges\nsays she reported Parker as well. However, nothing fruitful was found at the residence.\n\nIn December 2003, Parker was sentenced to eight years in federal prison on the mail and wire fraud charges. Normally the\nsentence for such crimes is 10 to 16 months, but the judge imposed a higher sentence in Parker's case due to the harm she\ncaused Brittany. She was also convicted of state charges of Medicaid fraud and sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nBrittany remains missing and her case is unsolved. Her Social Security number and Medicaid insurance card have not been used\nin any state since her disappearance. Investigators believe she is no longer alive; without using her Medicaid benefits, she would\nhave no way to get the medicine she needs to sustain her life. Foul play is suspected in her case.\n\nInvestigating Agency\n\nHenrico County Police Department 804-501-5000\n\nSource Information\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n\nPilot Online\n\nThe Kansas City Star\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\nOmega7 Incorporated\n\nMSNBC\n\nThe Child Seek Network\n\nTeam Amber Alert\n\nWVEC 13\n\nNamUs\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/brittany-renee-williams\n\n7/9\n\n\f9/9/25, 8:45 PM\n\nNBC 12\n\nBrittany Renee Williams - The Charley Project\n\nUpdated 10 times since October 12, 2004.

He lived with his father and three brothers, a five-year-old and two-year-old twins. His father, Cory Jamar Bigsby, said he woke up to find his son missing. He notified police at 9:00 a.m. that same day. A photo of Cory is posted with this case summary. In addition to his four children who lived with him on Ranalet Drive, he and his estranged wife have multiple older children living in the local area. Codi disappeared the same day the family was supposed to move to a new house. Authorities were immediately suspicious of Cory's story and believed Codi may not have disappeared at the time that his father claimed. On February 3, Cory was arrested for seven counts of felony child neglect. He admitted to leaving his children home alone on several occasions in December 2021 and January 2022 for hours at a time, with no way to contact him or emergency services. He said he did this because the children were \"too much of a handful\" and it didn't occur to him to get a babysitter. In July 2022, Cory was indicted for a further 23 charges: four counts of child abuse, two counts of child neglect in connection with the child abuse counts, fifteen counts of child neglect for leaving the children home alone, and two counts of child neglect for failure to secure medical attention for an injured child. None of the charges were connected to Codi's actual disappearance, only to Cory's alleged actions in the year prior to his son's disappearance. Cory is awaiting trial on these charges. If convicted, he could face a maximum term of 162 years in prison. Investigators stated his account of his son's disappearance did not match the evidence. His attorneys have claimed Cory was mistreated by the police and called the case a \"modern-day lynching.\" Cory was questioned between 9:30 p.m. on January 31 to 4:45 a.m. the next day, then he was taken to another room and isolated for eight hours. More than twenty times during the interview he said he was tired and wanted to go home, but he was told \"going home is not an option\" even though he was not under arrest at the time. Authorities also admitted that Cory had invoked his right to legal representation during the interview, twice, and that this was ignored. The detective was removed from the case and put on paid administrative leave as a result of the mishandled interrogation, and another detective was assigned to the case. It may be worth noting that there is a documented history of domestic violence between Cory and Codi's mother, Dina Abdul Kareem. He was charged with assaulting her in 2018 after she told police he had choked her, bitten her and threatened to kill her. https://charleyproject.org/case/codi-bigsby 5/9 9/9/25, 8:43 PM Codi Bigsby - The Charley Project The charges were dropped after Kareem stopped cooperating with the investigation and failed to appear for multiple court dates. She was investigated after Codi went missing and ruled out as a suspect in her son's case. In June 2023, Cory was charged with second-degree murder and concealment of a body in Codi's presumed death. Authorities stated they believed Codi was beaten to death by his father on June 18, 2021, six months prior to being reported missing, and that his body was buried in the state of Maryland. At Cory's trial in March 2024, Codi's brother, now seven years old, testified and said that as a four-year-old he had been unable to wake up Codi and his brother's face was bruised and red, and although Cory said Codi was fine, his brother thought Codi appeared to be dead. This was the last time he ever saw Codi. If the brother's memory is accurate and he was four years old when Codi disappeared, that would mean Codi was last seen sometime before December 24, 2021, the day his brother turned five. Kareem also testified, saying she had not been in a relationship with Cory since 2019. She said she left her children in Cory's care starting in 2020, after she was hospitalized. She stated Cory didn't initially want custody of Codi and called the child a \"mama's boy.\" Kareem testified the last time she saw any of her children prior to her disappearance was on November 1, 2020, and that Cory refused to give her his home address so she could visit them. She said she last spoke to Codi in April 2021, nine months before he was reported missing. That same month, Cory sent her an email saying, \"I need to bring Codi back to you, I don’t want to severely hurt him.\" He told her Codi had touched his younger brothers inappropriately, something Kareem did not believe. Cory maintained his innocence, but was convicted of both murder and concealment of a body. He faces up to 45 years in prison. He is still awaiting trial in the other offenses. The siblings Codi lived with at the time of his disappearance are now in foster care. Foul play is suspected in Codi's disappearance due to the circumstances involved.","behavioral_patterns":["at the time of his disappearance are now","this case summary.","assaulting her","Cory since 2019.

They were abducted by their non-custodial\nmother, Maria Rivera-Estevez. She took the children to the Dominican Republic without the permission of their father, Robert\nMakielski. They were in the middle of a divorce at the time.\n\nA photo of Maria is posted with this case summary.

That same month, a warrant was issued for Maria's arrest for custody violation.\n\nMaria applied for divorce and custody of Gabriel and Isabel in the Dominican Republic, and Robert hired a Dominican lawyer to get\nthe divorce case dismissed and represent him in the custody hearing. He said he was afraid to physically attend the hearing\nbecause he'd been threatened, and the Dominican court judge refused to let him attend via video conference.\n\nThe Dominican court refused to return the children to Robert's care, because Maria alleged he'd abused them; Robert claims the\njudge committed numerous violations of the Hague Treaty.\n\nIn December 2012, the Culpeper County Circuit Court in Virginia granted sole physical and legal custody of Isabel and Gabriel to\ntheir father. There is also a felony warrant on file for Maria.\n\nThe custody ruling and the warrant are unenforceable, however, as long as the children and their mother remain in the Dominican\nRepublic.\n\nRobert hasn't seen his children or had contact with them since their mother abducted them. They were last known to be living in\nthe capital city of Santo Domingo.

They were abducted by their non-\ncustodial mother, Maria Rivera-Estevez. She took the children to the Dominican Republic without the permission of their father,\nRobert Makielski. They were in the middle of a divorce at the time.\n\nA photo of Maria is posted with this case summary. Her date of birth is May 18, 1969, making her 31 years old at the time of the\nchildren's abductions. She's described as Hispanic, 5'4 and 125 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.\n\nRobert stated he attempted to resolve the problem through mediation, but Maria didn't respond to his overtures.

That same month, a warrant was issued for Maria's arrest for custody violation.\n\nMaria applied for divorce and custody of Gabriel and Isabel in the Dominican Republic, and Robert hired a Dominican lawyer to get\nthe divorce case dismissed and represent him in the custody hearing. He said he was afraid to physically attend the hearing\nbecause he'd been threatened, and the Dominican court judge refused to let him attend via video conference.\n\nThe Dominican court refused to return the children to Robert's care, because Maria alleged he'd abused them; Robert claims the\njudge committed numerous violations of the Hague Treaty.\n\nIn December 2012, the Culpeper County Circuit Court in Virginia granted sole physical and legal custody of Isabel and Gabriel to\ntheir father. There is also a felony warrant on file for Maria.\n\nThe custody ruling and the warrant are unenforceable, however, as long as the children and their mother remain in the Dominican\nRepublic.\n\nRobert hasn't seen his children or had contact with them since their mother abducted them. They were last known to be living in\nthe capital city of Santo Domingo.

She is left-handed.\n\nDetails of Disappearance\n\nJennifer was last seen in the Kingsmill area of Williamsburg, Virginia on February 10, 1987. She was reportedly distraught because\nshe and her boyfriend were having problems. Her mother woke up sometime after 6:00 a.m. and discovered Jennifer's bedroom\ndoor was locked.

Jennifer was gone. She has never been heard from again. She took only her purse with her,\nleaving behind all her other personal belongings, including her coat. A note was left behind. It started out in the third person,\nstating:\n\nYour daughter's with me. She's fine. She's having some problems and needs some time away.\n\nThe note then switched to the first person, though it was still in the same writing:\n\nI'm fine, I just need time to think. Both of you please go to work tomorrow ‘cause I will try to call you. I won't call you at home, only\nat one of y'all's work. Do not call the police. I can easily find out if you do. I may never come back home. Don't tell my friends about\nthis. Just tell them that I'm sick.\n\nThe note did not appear to be in Jennifer's handwriting, but her mother said she believed she did in fact write it. Some\ninvestigators theorized that Jennifer, who is left-handed, wrote the note with her right hand to change the writing.\n\nJennifer's boyfriend was interviewed by police and admitted they'd been having relationship problems, but he was not involved in\nher disappearance and was as shocked by it as anyone else. He isn't considered a suspect in her case.\n\nShe was a sophomore at Lafayette High School in 1987, didn't use drugs or alcohol, and wasn't having any apparent problems with\nher parents, her friends or at school. Her parents, who moved away 1990, said they hope she is still alive and will return home. Her\nfather now resides in Texas and her mother in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nJennifer's brother, Stephen, was away at college when she disappeared. He said he immediately suspected his parents were\ninvolved in her disappearance, in part because they didn't report her missing for three days. Stephen said their father was a\nveteran who struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder and had violent outbursts that were \"scary.\" Stephen stated he even\nsought legal advice to see if he could sue them for her wrongful death.\n\nNo one has ever been charged in Jennifer's case, and her parents deny having had anything to do with her disappearance.\nInvestigators stated there was no evidence of a crime in her case and they think she left of her own accord.

She was spending the night with her Tammy; her own family lived in an apartment in the Four Seasons subdivision off Rio Road. Katie's friend's mother, Carrie Gates, called Katie's parents early that morning, thinking the girl had returned to her own apartment. https://charleyproject.org/case/katherine-sybil-worsky 3/7 9/9/25, 8:50 PM Katherine Sybil Worsky - The Charley Project She had not, however. Katie's parents notified police of her disappearance. Glenn Haslam Barker was one of the people who volunteered in the effort to search for Katie. A photograph of him is posted with this case summary. He had previously dated Carrie, but their relationship was over by July 1982. He was employed as a clerk at a gas station and convenience store which Katie's father frequently patronized. Authorities suspected Barker immediately in part due to his criminal record; he pleaded guilty to assault in 1981 after admitting to kidnapping teenage female acquaintance and holding her at knifepoint. Police interrogated him at Katie's disappearance. He admitted having seen her on the night she went missing. He stated he had come by the Gates home after everyone had gone to bed, and had given Katie and Tammy one can of beer each. Tammy said she and Katie had actually had more alcohol than that, and got sick afterwards. Afterwards, they went to bed. Barker stated he left at 12:30 a.m., after making sure Katie, Tammy and Tammy's younger brother were asleep. Tammy woke up at 5:30 a.m. and realized Katie was missing. Investigators did not believe Barker's story and, with his permission, searched his apartment in the Hessian Hills apartment complex on Georgetown Road. They found wet, bloodstained men's clothing and towels wedged between his mattress and box spring. Some of the blood was Type A, Barker's blood type, and some was Type B.

Authorities searched the residence a second time several days later and found a pair of girls' panties hidden in a rolled-up ball of socks in Barker's dresser. There was a tiny bloodstain in the back of the panties, consistent with the location where Katie injected her insulin. Barker was arrested and charged with Katie's murder in January 1983, six months after she went missing. Prosecutors theorized that after Katie became intoxicated, Barker carried her to the living room, attempted to molest her, then killed her.

They acquitted him of first-degree murder, meaning they did not believe Katie's murder was premeditated. He was only the second person to be convicted of murder in Virginia without the victim's body. Barker was paroled from prison in 1992. He was rearrested in 1993 and charged with possession of a firearm after a pellet gun was found in his car, and served a further six months in jail before being released again. Barker's name has been mentioned in connection with other homicides and missing persons cases and some theorize he was a serial murderer. He was never charged with any deaths besides Katie's, however, and maintained he he didn't harm Katie and the only wrongdoing he committed that night was giving her and Tammy beer when they were underage. Barker stated he believed he had been framed by the police, and accused them of planting the bloodstained clothing found in his apartment. He died of natural causes in North Carolina in 2014, at the age of 55. Katie's parents divorced after Barker's conviction.

Blonde hair, hazel eyes. Katherine has Type B blood. Her nickname is Katie and most accounts refer to her by\nthat name.\n\nDetails of Disappearance\n\nKatie was last seen at the home of a friend, Tammy Gates, in the 2700 block of McElroy Drive in Charlottesville, Virginia on July 12,\n1982. She was spending the night with her Tammy; her own family lived in an apartment in the Four Seasons subdivision off Rio\nRoad.\n\nKatie's friend's mother, Carrie Gates, called Katie's parents early that morning, thinking the girl had returned to her own apartment.\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/katherine-sybil-worsky\n\n3/7\n\n\f9/9/25, 8:50 PM\n\nKatherine Sybil Worsky - The Charley Project\n\nShe had not, however. Katie's parents notified police of her disappearance.\n\nGlenn Haslam Barker was one of the people who volunteered in the effort to search for Katie. A photograph of him is posted with\nthis case summary. He had previously dated Carrie, but their relationship was over by July 1982. He was employed as a clerk at a\ngas station and convenience store which Katie's father frequently patronized.\n\nAuthorities suspected Barker immediately in part due to his criminal record; he pleaded guilty to assault in 1981 after admitting to\nkidnapping teenage female acquaintance and holding her at knifepoint. Police interrogated him at Katie's disappearance.\n\nHe admitted having seen her on the night she went missing. He stated he had come by the Gates home after everyone had gone\nto bed, and had given Katie and Tammy one can of beer each. Tammy said she and Katie had actually had more alcohol than that,\nand got sick afterwards. Afterwards, they went to bed.\n\nBarker stated he left at 12:30 a.m., after making sure Katie, Tammy and Tammy's younger brother were asleep. Tammy woke up at\n5:30 a.m. and realized Katie was missing.\n\nInvestigators did not believe Barker's story and, with his permission, searched his apartment in the Hessian Hills apartment\ncomplex on Georgetown Road. They found wet, bloodstained men's clothing and towels wedged between his mattress and box\nspring.\n\nSome of the blood was Type A, Barker's blood type, and some was Type B. Katie's blood was Type B; authorities discovered this\nfact by testing the menstrual blood on her bedsheets. Barker said he did not know how the clothes had gotten there.\n\nAuthorities searched the residence a second time several days later and found a pair of girls' panties hidden in a rolled-up ball of\nsocks in Barker's dresser.

At the time of her disappearance, she was in the care of Candi Jo Royer and lived with her in Waynesboro, Virginia. Khaleesi's mother, Amanda G. Arey, had placed her daughter in Royer's care in October 2020, while Arey was incarcerated in the Middle River Regional Jail for parole violation. Royer was reported missing on September 3 and was believed to be with her boyfriend, Travis Brown, who had been a fugitive wanted by police in five different jurisdictions since August 21. He had fourteen charges against him, including strangulation, grand larceny, and assault and battery of a family member among other offenses. Photos of Royer and Brown are posted with this case summary. Police stated the pair had been going on a crime spree across Virginia and Pennsylvania since Royer went missing. When Arey found out Royer was missing, she told jail authorities that Royer had her child. By this time, Royer had stopped communicating with Arey in jail, and Arey hadn't heard from her or Brown in months and was concerned about her daughter's safety. Arey had been told that Royer placed Khaleesi with the child's maternal grandmother or aunt in the Covington, Virginia area, but this was untrue. Royer and Brown were located in Pennsylvania on September 12, and arrested. They had driven there in a stolen car and were hiding in a motel. They did not have Khaleesi and initially claimed workers with Shenandoah Valley Social Services had taken her, something Shenandoah Valley Social Services denied. Eventually Rowan said Khaleesi had died after accidentally striking her head, and he wrapped her body in a blanket and put it in the trash. Royer was charged with abuse/neglect of a child resulting in serious injury; Brown wasn't charged directly in Khaleesi's disappearance, but was held on other, unrelated charges. A little over a week later, police announced Khaleesi was dead, and had died while in the couple's care at Royer's home in the 200 block of Cattle Scales Road in Waynesboro around January 2021. https://charleyproject.org/case/khaleesi-hope-cuthriell 4/7 9/9/25, 8:43 PM Khaleesi Hope Cuthriell - The Charley Project A video taken of Khaleesi in January 2021 showed the child was covered with bruises, frail and unable to stand.

Hair found in electrical tape wrapped around a bent wire hanger also matched Khaleesi's DNA. Brown made strange claims about the four-year-old to the police, stating she was suicidal and also sexually aware, and that she had once tried to choke his own daughter. In May 2022, Royer and Brown were indicted for Khaleesi's murder. Each was charged with aggravated murder, felony murder, unlawfully concealing a dead body, conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, conspiracy to commit child abuse, and conspiracy to concceal a dead body. Brown was also charged with child abuse/neglect resulting in serious injury. In August 2023, Brown was convicted of aggravated murder, felony murder and child abuse in Khaleesi's death, though his attorney tried to place the blame on Royer. At the trial, an expert on child abuse said how Khaleesi was treated \"fits the definition of child torture.\" Two weeks after Brown's conviction, Royer pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The other charges against her were dropped. The pair have yet to be sentenced. Khaleesi's body has never been located, but foul play is suspected due to the circumstances involved.

Light brown hair, blue eyes. Melissa has a burn scar on her right forearm.\n\nDetails of Disappearance\n\nMelissa was last seen at a holiday party in the Woodside Apartment Clubhouse, at approximately 10:00 p.m. on December 3, 1989\nin Lorton, Virginia. Her family resided in the apartment complex. Melissa and her mother were about to leave the party but Melissa\nwent to get some more potato chips before they left, and was never seen again. There were approximately eighty guests present\nat the party at the time.\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/melissa-lee-brannen\n\n5/9\n\n\f9/9/25, 8:40 PM\n\nMelissa Lee Brannen - The Charley Project\n\nCaleb Daniel Hughes emerged as a suspect in Melissa's case almost immediately. Photos of him are posted with this case\nsummary. Hughes was employed as a groundskeeper at Woodside Apartments at the time of Melissa's disappearance; he had\nworked there for only about two weeks.\n\nHe was a guest at Melissa's family's party the evening of her disappearance, had been sitting near her when she was last seen,\nand left at approximately the same time the child was discovered missing. He had a criminal record prior to Melissa's\ndisappearance, but not for violent or sexual offenses.\n\nInvestigators looked for Hughes right after Melissa's disappearance was discovered, but did not find him until 1:00 a.m. the next\nday. He had already put his party clothes in the washing machine. The FBI took blood, hair and fiber evidence from Hughes's\nmaroon Honda and tested it in a forensic laboratory.\n\nThe laboratory found that Melissa could be a source for the hair and the bloodstains, which were found on some tissues in the car,\nbut so could 40% of the general population. Further testing ruled out Melissa as a source for the stains. However, rabbit hairs\nfound in the car matched Melissa's rabbit-fur jacket and there were many blue fibers that matched her sweater and some red\nfibers consistent with her skirt.\n\nHughes was convicted of abducting Melissa with the intent to defile in 1991, and sentenced to 50 years in prison. He has always\nmaintained his innocence in Melissa's case. He was an exemplary prisoner for most of his term, and accumulated enough good\nbehavior credits to shorten his sentence. As a result, he was released from prison in August 2019, after serving just 29 years of\nhis sentence.\n\nTwo other men were convicted of attempting to extort ransom money from Melissa's mother shortly after her daughter's\ndisappearance. The individuals were not connected to her actual abduction. Melissa has never been located. Foul play is\nsuspected in her case due to the circumstances involved.\n\nInvestigating Agency\n\nFairfax County Sheriff's Department\n\n703-246-7800\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/melissa-lee-brannen\n\n6/9\n\n\fMelissa Lee Brannen - The Charley Project\n\n9/9/25, 8:40 PM\n\n202-324-3000\n\nSource Information\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n\nChild Protection Education of America\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Times\n\nOffice of the Inspector General\n\nConnection Newspapers\n\nVirginia Department of Corrections\n\nPeople Magazine\n\nWAFF 48\n\nUpdated 8 times since October 12, 2004.
