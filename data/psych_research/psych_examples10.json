        "risk_escalation": "Risk escalates when a chronically offending adult, already involved in assaults, property crimes, and sometimes forcible sex offenses, encounters an accessible child in a poorly supervised context and uses abduction to facilitate sexual assault and, in many cases, murder. Fatal outcomes are more likely when the offender is prepared to use lethal violence (strangulation, blunt force, stabbing, or shooting) to silence the victim and avoid detection.",

        "escalation_timeline": "Many offenders show a progression from non-sexual crimes (property, assault, drugs) in youth and early adulthood into sexual and kidnapping offenses against both adults and children. When an abduction occurs, the sequence often escalates quickly from initial contact to sexual assault and then, in a significant proportion of cases, to murder within the first day as the offender attempts to avoid detection or exerts violent control."

        "Offenders: only a small fraction (around 8%) are registered sex offenders at the time of the abduction, meaning many high-risk offenders are not flagged in registries.",
        "Offenders: a notable minority (about 25%) have no recorded adult criminal history despite committing severe abduction crimes.",
        "Victims: older child age is associated with higher likelihood of being found murdered or presumed dead (pubertal/early adolescent victims at greater fatal risk than younger children).",
        "Victims: female children are abducted about three and a half times more often than male children overall.",
        "Victims: non-minority (often Caucasian) children are disproportionately represented among fatal outcomes compared to minority children.",
        "Victims: being abducted alone (rather than in a group of children or a child-plus-adult scenario) increases the likelihood of a fatal outcome.",
        "Offender–victim pairing: in roughly four out of five cases, the offender and victim are of the same race; cross-racial pairings occur but are less common.",
