      "motive_patterns": {
        "grooming_duration": "The study does not report a fixed grooming duration; instead, many offenders built familiarity with the victim, the household, and the neighborhood over repeated visits, sometimes observing the child and residence in the days or weeks before the abduction.",
        "preferred_locations": [
          "Interior of single-family residences (majority of cases)",
          "Apartments (minority of cases)",
          "Victim’s bedroom while the child was sleeping",

          "Secondary outdoor locations after removal (fields, wooded areas, camping areas/parks, nearby backyards)"
        ],
        "risk_escalation": "Risk increases as offenders gain familiarity with the child, the family, and the residence, especially when households are chaotic, resource-limited, and frequently leave doors or windows unsecured; escalation commonly culminates in a nighttime or early-morning entry when guardianship is weakest and the child is asleep.",
        "decision_factors": [
          "Sexual motivation is the primary driver in most cases (over four-fifths of offenders were sexually motivated).",
          "Offenders are overwhelmingly male, largely unmarried, and often socially marginal with poor or unstable intimate relationships.",
          "Prior criminal history is common, particularly burglary and assault, which contributes to offender comfort with unlawful entry into dwellings.",
          "Offenders frequently have prior lawful or unlawful familiarity with the general area and/or the victim’s residence, including previous visits inside the home.",
          "Victim age and gender strongly influence targeting: primarily school-aged girls, around 6–11 years old, abducted for sexual purposes.",
          "Household characteristics (stressful, chaotic, transient occupants, unsecured doors/windows) lower perceived risk and increase opportunity.",
          "Low level of forensic planning and impulsive decision-making once the opportunity (sleeping child, unsecured home, low guardianship) presents itself."

        "Observed stalking behavior: offender watching the child near the home or in the general area prior to the abduction.",

        "Entry during hours when guardians and children are expected to be asleep (midnight to early morning).",

        "Sexualized focus on children combined with failed or problematic attempts to engage adult sexual partners.",

        "escalation_timeline": "Typical escalation involves an offender who becomes aware of the child and household, repeatedly visits or passes through the area, notes vulnerabilities (unlocked entry points, sleeping patterns, guardianship gaps), and then conducts a covert nighttime entry to remove the sleeping child with little or no resistance; in rare infant or revenge cases, overt daytime entries using ruse or force coincide with a more direct, emotionally charged escalation."
