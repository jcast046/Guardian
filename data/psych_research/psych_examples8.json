        "grooming_duration": "This article synthesizes research rather than specifying exact grooming timelines, but emphasizes that many child molesters gradually build trust and legitimate access to children over repeated contacts (e.g., as neighbors, babysitters, authority figures, or through jobs that provide ongoing contact), often over weeks, months, or longer.",

        "risk_escalation": "Risk escalates when offenders obtain repeated legitimate access to children and families, are perceived as familiar and trustworthy rather than as strangers, and when cultural messages focus narrowly on ‘stranger danger’ instead of on the far more common risk from known individuals. Risk also increases when children are not encouraged to disclose uncomfortable situations due to ‘don’t be a tattletale’ norms and unconditional pressure to obey adults.",
        "decision_factors": [
          "Offenders seek legitimate, routine access to children (e.g., by choosing jobs or roles that place them in regular contact with minors).",
          "Most sexual offenders against children are male and prefer victims they can reach through preexisting relationships or community roles.",
          "Offenders exploit children’s limited ability to understand motives and to accurately identify ‘dangerous’ people, especially when those adults are polite, friendly, or familiar.",
          "Offenders rely on social myths: children equate ‘stranger’ with someone who looks scary or odd, so offenders present as caring, normal, or friendly.",
          "The fact that parents often focus on stranger danger (and sex offender registries) while underestimating risk from relatives, neighbors, and acquaintances creates blind spots that offenders can exploit.",

        "escalation_timeline": "Long-standing myths (‘don’t talk to strangers’) and communication norms (‘don’t be a tattletale,’ unconditional respect for adults) create an environment over years in which offenders can groom and access children with little scrutiny. Offenders often begin as familiar, trusted figures; repeated contact builds trust, reduces suspicion, and gradually increases opportunities for boundary violations and eventual sexual assault or abduction."

        "In both older and more recent clinical samples of child molesters, 66–80% of offenders were known to their victims, undermining the idea that ‘stranger’ is the primary threat.",

One afternoon, while the babysitter is distracted, the boyfriend isolates the 8-year-old child in another room and molests them.
