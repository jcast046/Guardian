        "grooming_duration": "Stranger and nonfamily abductions are generally described as opportunistic and event-focused rather than involving long, extended grooming; when prior contact exists (slight acquaintances), it typically develops over days to weeks through casual neighborhood or community interactions rather than intensive, months-long grooming.",
        "preferred_locations": [
          "Areas near the child’s home or neighborhood (streets, sidewalks, yards, local play areas).",
          "Routes to and from school or other routine activities (walking routes, bus stops, paths to friends’ houses).",
          "Public spaces where children may be alone or lightly supervised (parks, vacant lots, shopping areas, recreational spaces).",
          "In stereotypical kidnapping cases, initial contact often occurs in the child’s ordinary environment, with subsequent transport to a secondary, more isolated location."
        ],
        "risk_escalation": "Risk escalates when an offender encounters a child who is alone or lightly supervised, especially in public or semi-public settings near home or school. The danger increases sharply when the child is forcibly moved to another location, held overnight, or transported a substantial distance away, transforming a brief encounter into a stereotypical kidnapping with a higher likelihood of serious injury or death.",
        "decision_factors": [
          "Opportunity to isolate a child who is alone or apart from peers or adults.",
          "Perceived vulnerability of the victim (younger age, small size, lack of resistance, apparent naivete).",
          "Sexual interest in children, particularly among male offenders targeting girls and young teens.",
          "Situational factors such as access to a vehicle, familiarity with the local area, and availability of secluded locations.",
          "Desire to avoid detection, which can drive decisions to move the child, restrain them, or, in extreme cases, kill to eliminate a witness.",
          "In some cases, additional motives such as robbery, anger, or general violence that intersect with sexual motives or control."

        ],
        "duration_patterns": "Many nonfamily abductions are brief and end within the same day, especially those that do not involve extended transport or detention. In more serious stereotypical kidnappings, the child may be held overnight or longer, with the highest risk of serious harm in the first hours following abduction.",
        "escalation_timeline": "A typical escalation begins with an opportunistic encounter when a child is alone, followed by a rapid decision to initiate contact, lure, or use force. If the offender successfully moves the child to a secondary location, risk escalates to sexual assault and, in a subset of cases, to homicide or long-term disappearance. Most fatal outcomes and serious injuries occur within a relatively short period after the initial abduction."

        "Victim age: older children and adolescents, especially early teens, are at higher risk for nonfamily abductions with sexual or violent components; younger children are at risk but somewhat less frequently targeted by strangers.",
        "Victim gender: girls are more often victims of sexually motivated abductions; boys are also victimized, particularly in certain age groups and contexts.",
        "Situational low guardianship: children walking alone, playing outside without close adult supervision, or moving between locations (home, school, friends’ houses).",
        "Environmental factors such as residential neighborhoods with accessible streets, alleys, or secluded spots where children move around unsupervised.",
        "Offender characteristics that include male gender, prior or latent sexual interest in children, and, in more serious cases, histories of violence or criminal behavior.",

        "typical_distances": "Many nonfamily abductions are local, with initial contact and victim recovery occurring within the same community. Stereotypical kidnappings, as defined in national surveys, often involve longer-distance travel (e.g., 50 miles or more) or extended detention (overnight or longer), indicating movement beyond the child’s immediate environment.",
