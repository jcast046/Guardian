        "grooming_duration": "This report is policy- and incidence-focused and does not quantify grooming timelines; it emphasizes that sexual exploitation can occur both when children are missing and when they are not, and that exploitation may be ongoing rather than a single event.",

          "Missing episodes occur across multiple contexts including family abductions, nonfamily abductions, runaways/thrownaways, children who become lost or injured, and benign situations such as schedule misunderstandings.",

        ],
        "risk_escalation": "The report highlights that missing children and sexually exploited children are distinct but overlapping populations: some missing children are sexually exploited and some exploited children are never reported missing. It implies escalation when missing episodes intersect with sexual exploitation or trafficking, but does not provide a detailed stepwise offender risk escalation model.",
        "decision_factors": [
          "Opportunity structures such as gaps in supervision (e.g., runaway episodes, benign misunderstandings, children being lost or stranded).",

          "System-level decisions that shape response and offender behavior, such as AMBER Alert criteria (imminent danger, sufficient descriptive information, child age, and NCIC entry) and the extent of law enforcement and public mobilization.",

        "duration_patterns": "The NISMART-3 survey defines a ‘caretaker missing’ episode as one where a child’s whereabouts are unknown long enough (at least one hour) for the caretaker to become alarmed and actively attempt to locate the child; ‘reported missing’ cases add the step of contacting law enforcement or a missing children’s agency. Stereotypical kidnappings, as defined in the report, involve extended duration markers such as overnight detention or long-distance transport.",
        "escalation_timeline": "Over the period between NISMART-2 (1999) and NISMART-3 (2013), the overall rate of both caretaker-missing and reported-missing episodes declined, largely due to fewer benign-missing incidents, possibly influenced by wider cell phone use. The report does not provide a detailed timeline of how individual cases escalate from initial contact to abduction or exploitation, but it notes that missing incidents can quickly become high-risk when they involve abduction or sexual exploitation."

        "Female sex: girls have higher reported rates of sexual victimization than boys, both within the past year and across the lifetime.",
        "Broad exposure to violence and victimization: sexual abuse often co-occurs with other forms of victimization, increasing overall vulnerability.",
        "Online exposure to adults or older youth who engage in sexual grooming, send obscene material, or attempt online enticement.",
        "Homelessness or unstable housing, including youth who have left home without adequate support and may be more vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation.",

During the three days she is gone, she stays with older acquaintances she met online and is pressured into sexual activity in exchange for a place to sleep.

The electronic service provider detects the abusive content, files a mandatory report to the national CyberTipline, and law enforcement is notified.
