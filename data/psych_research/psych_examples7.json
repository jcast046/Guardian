        "grooming_duration": "The study does not describe short-term grooming in detail; instead, it shows that motives and opportunities tend to build over longer periods (months or years) in family cases through custody conflict and relationship breakdown, while many nonfamily abductions appear more opportunistic and linked to immediate criminal motives such as sexual assault or robbery.",
        "preferred_locations": [

        "risk_escalation": "Risk escalates when children are in settings with reduced guardianship (after school and evening hours), when there are unresolved custody disputes or separations that increase family tension, and when older youth, especially girls, move through public spaces (streets, highways, parking lots) where nonfamily offenders can act on sexual or profit-driven motives. As children age from preschool into adolescence, the likelihood shifts from family to acquaintance and stranger offenders, reflecting changing routine activities and exposure to higher-risk environments.",

          "For acquaintance offenders: existing social or neighborhood connection to the child or family, easier access to the child in or near the home, and opportunity when guardianship is low.",
          "For stranger offenders: opportunity in public or semi-public spaces, especially streets, highways, and parking lots, often linked to sexual motives for girls and profit/robbery motives for boys.",
          "Offender age and gender patterns: most offenders are male, and nonfamily offenders are disproportionately young adults (20–29) or under 30, while acquaintance offenders include a larger share of juveniles than family or stranger offenders.",
          "Victim age and gender: young children (0–5) are more often targeted by family members, while older children and teens (12–17), especially girls, are more often targeted by acquaintances and strangers, consistent with sexual victimization motives."

For nonfamily offenders: escalation is more closely tied to the child’s age and daily routine, with risk increasing as older youth spend more unsupervised time in public or semi-public locations during after-school and evening hours."
