      "grooming_duration": "The study describes preferential offenders whose sexual interest in children typically begins in adolescence and persists over many years. Grooming (both online and offline) is described as an extended process involving repeated contacts and gradual desensitization, rather than a brief or one-time interaction, but no specific average duration in weeks or months is given.",
      "preferred_locations": [
        "Online environments used to access children and abuse imagery (chat rooms, email, peer-to-peer networks, online advertisements, social platforms).",

        "Neighborhood and family networks where offenders have ongoing, non-stranger relationships with children."
      ],
      "risk_escalation": "Risk increases when an offender’s persistent sexual interest in children is combined with regular access to minors (living with children, working or volunteering around them), when they collect and organize child sexual abuse images that reflect a clear preference for children, and when they interact with like-minded offenders online who validate and reinforce their behavior. Co-occurring behaviors (possession, contact, production, and travel to meet minors) show that offending often spans multiple categories rather than remaining limited to a single behavior.",
      "decision_factors": [
        "Presence of a preferential sexual interest in children, often obsessive and fantasy-driven, rather than purely opportunistic lust toward whoever is available.",
        "Availability of online tools (Internet, peer-to-peer networks, chat rooms, email) that provide easy access to child sexual abuse material, perceived anonymity, and opportunities to contact minors.",
        "Access to children through family roles, household composition (living with minors), employment or volunteer positions of trust (education, counseling, clergy, law enforcement, medical, childcare).",
        "Emotional congruence with children and difficulty forming or sustaining intimate adult relationships, which can drive offenders toward children as preferred or important sexual partners.",
        "Use of child pornography collections (including specific themes, ages, and acts) to support fantasies, guide offending behavior, and sometimes to groom or coerce victims.",
        "Use of alcohol or drugs as disinhibitors that increase impulsivity and lower internal restraints against sexual offending."

      "motive_categories": [
        "Preferential child sex offending characterized by a persistent sexual interest in children, often expressed through both online material and contact offending.",

        "Possession and trading of child sexual abuse material primarily for sexual arousal and fantasy reinforcement.",

      "duration_patterns": "The study is based on resolved investigations and does not quantify typical time from first online activity to arrest, or from contact offending onset to detection. It emphasizes that sexual interest in children is often long-standing and that many contact offenses are only uncovered after investigation of an online crime.",
      "escalation_timeline": "Offenders often show a long-term pattern beginning with early sexual interest in children, followed by the collection of child sexual abuse material, participation in online communities of like-minded offenders, and co-occurring behaviors such as contact offending, production of images, and traveling to meet minors. In some situational traveler cases, an offender with a history of adult-focused pornography and no child imagery responds to online opportunities that present a minor, illustrating more opportunistic escalation."

      "Presence of a criminal history in a minority of offenders, but when present, relatively high rates of prior felony sex crimes against children and nuisance sex offenses.",
