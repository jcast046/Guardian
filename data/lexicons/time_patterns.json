      "Typical escalation involves an offender who becomes aware of the child and household, repeatedly visits or passes through the area, notes vulnerabilities (unlocked entry points, sleeping patterns, guardianship gaps), and then conducts a covert nighttime entry to remove the sleeping child with little or no resistance",
      "For family abductions: relationship conflict, separation/divorce, and custody disputes build over time, followed by threats or withholding, and then a precipitating event (such as a custody hearing or visitation disagreement) that precedes the abduction",
      "For nonfamily offenders: escalation is more closely tied to the child's age and daily routine, with risk increasing as older youth spend more unsupervised time in public or semi-public locations during after-school and evening hours",
      "In many cases where prior contact existed, last known contact between offender and victim occurred within a week of the abduction, with a substantial portion within 24 hours"
    ],
    "duration_patterns": [
      "Call lengths ranged widely (39 seconds to ~16 minutes), but duration did not differ between truthful and false allegation callers",
      "In cited work on child abduction murders, approximately 74% of abducted children who were killed died within the first 3 hours and about 91% within 24 hours of the abduction, indicating that the highest fatal risk window is the first few hours after disappearance",
      "Many nonfamily abductions are brief and end within the same day, especially those that do not involve extended transport or detention. In more serious stereotypical kidnappings, the child may be held overnight or longer, with the highest risk of serious harm in the first hours following abduction"
