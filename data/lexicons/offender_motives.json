      "decision_factors": [
        "Sexual motivation is the primary driver in most cases (over four-fifths of offenders were sexually motivated)",
        "Offenders are overwhelmingly male, largely unmarried, and often socially marginal with poor or unstable intimate relationships",
        "Prior criminal history is common, particularly burglary and assault, which contributes to offender comfort with unlawful entry into dwellings",
        "Offenders frequently have prior lawful or unlawful familiarity with the general area and/or the victim's residence, including previous visits inside the home",
        "Victim age and gender strongly influence targeting: primarily school-aged girls, around 6-11 years old, abducted for sexual purposes",
        "Household characteristics (stressful, chaotic, transient occupants, unsecured doors/windows) lower perceived risk and increase opportunity",
        "Low level of forensic planning and impulsive decision-making once the opportunity (sleeping child, unsecured home, low guardianship) presents itself"

      ],
      "grooming_duration": "Many offenders built familiarity with the victim, the household, and the neighborhood over repeated visits, sometimes observing the child and residence in the days or weeks before the abduction. Grooming can range from 2-4 weeks for sexual offenders to weeks or months for online grooming.",
      "risk_escalation": "Risk increases as offenders gain familiarity with the child, the family, and the residence, especially when households are chaotic, resource-limited, and frequently leave doors or windows unsecured; escalation commonly culminates in a nighttime or early-morning entry when guardianship is weakest and the child is asleep."

        "Severe sociopathic or narcissistic traits, including contempt for law and use of the child as an instrument of revenge or control",
        "Strong identification with an ethnic or religious homeland following dissolution of a mixed-culture marriage, with desire to raise the child in that culture",
        "Economic hardship, low education, and alienation from the legal system, combined with strong support in another community or country",
        "History of family violence and/or child abuse, especially when the victimized parent feels unprotected by courts and child protection systems",

      "grooming_duration": "The research focuses on long-building family conflict, abuse allegations, and legal alienation rather than short-term grooming; risk accumulates over months to years of high conflict, domestic violence, poverty, and distrust of the legal system.",
      "risk_escalation": "Risk escalates when high-conflict, low-income, or culturally alienated parents face separation/divorce, unresolved allegations of abuse or neglect, feel unprotected by courts or child protective services, and gain emotional and logistical support from extended family, friends, or underground networks who support self-help solutions over legal processes."

        "Biological embedding of early adversity (HPA axis dysregulation, allostatic load, epigenetic changes) increasing vulnerability to addiction and poor coping",
        "Increased alcohol and drug use (often after recruitment) that both self-medicate trauma and deepen dependence on traffickers",

      "grooming_duration": "Recruitment and control typically develop over weeks to months, layered on top of years of prior adversity (abuse, neglect, insecure attachment, poverty) that create a long-standing vulnerability before the trafficker appears.",
      "risk_escalation": "Risk escalates as early adversity (abuse, neglect, multiple caregivers, poverty, exposure to violence) produces insecure attachment and biological embedding of chronic stress, which in turn impairs judgment, emotional regulation, and relationship discernment. Traffickers then exploit these vulnerabilities through false affection, promises of belonging, and material support, leading to trauma bonding and increased substance use."
